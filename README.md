# introduction-to-robotics

A collection of software developed for the Turtlebot 3 Waffle Pi through the course ROB301 - Introduction to Robotics.
Programs written in Python and developed through the Robot Operating System (ROS).

This repository includes software for the following tasks:
1. [Sensor & Actuator Programming](Lab1_Sensor_Actuator)
2. [Pose-to-Pose Control](Lab2_Pose_to_Pose_Control)
3. [Path Following with PID](Lab3_Path_Following)
4. [Extended Kalman Filtering](Lab4_Kalman_Filter)

This repository also includes all software and documentation for the [Final Design Project](Final_Design_Project) of the course, which is to design and test a control system that enables a Turtlebot 3 Waffle Pi robot to simulate mail delivery.
